Implement the `insertionSort` function and modify the `quicksortHelper()` function so that it calls **insertion sort** to sort any sublist whose size is less than **50** items.

Compare the performance of this version with that of the original one, using data sets of 50, 500, and 5000 items.

Afterwards, adjust the threshold for using the insertion sort to determine an optimal setting based on your findings from the step above.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *testquicksort.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
[21, 16, 13, 17, 18, 14, 20, 18, 7, 10, 6, 4, 12, 17, 12, 1, 3, 4, 15, 19]
[1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20, 21]
```
>Output may vary because list is generated randomly
