The Fibonacci sequence is, by definition, the integer sequence in which every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

In the *fib.py* file, complete the following:
1. Modify the recursive `Fibonacci` function to employ the memoization technique discussed in this chapter. 
	- Form a base case for any number in the sequence, except for the first and second, is the sum of the previous two
	> A base case in a recursive function tells the function when to stop (to avoid going into an infinite loop)
	- The function should expect a dictionary as an additional argument. The top-level call of the function receives an empty dictionary. 
	- The function’s keys and values should be the arguments and values of the recursive calls. 
	- Use the counter object discussed in this chapter to count the number of recursive calls.
	> Counter is already provided in the `main()` method

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *fib.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
   n         fib
   2           1
   4           3
   8          21
  16         987
  32     2178309
  ```
