Complete the hashing implementation of a hash-based set. 

> Thus, the implementation must maintain an array and represent entries in such a manner as to allow chaining.

In the *hashset.py* file complete the following methods: 
1. `__str__`
2. `__iter__`
3. `remove()`

In the `AbstractSet` class of the *abstractset.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `__eq__` function
	- Returns `True` if self equals other, or `False` otherwise.

Test the hashing implementation with the `test()` method located in the *testset.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

```
Testing <class 'hashset.HashSet'>
The list of items added is: [2013, 61, 1973, 1973]
Length, expect 3: 3
Expect the set's string: {1973, ...., 61}
Expect True: True
Expect False: ....
Expect the items on separate lines:
1973
....
61
Expect {}: {}
Expect {}: {}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
s1: {...., 2013, ..} s2: {...., 61, ..}
s1 | s2: {1973, ...., .., 44}
s1 & s2: {...., 61}
s1 - s2: {....}
s2 - s1: {44}
Expect {}: {}
```
