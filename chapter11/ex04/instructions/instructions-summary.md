Modify the `Profiler` class in the *profiler.py* file to allow the programmer to study the behavior of the `HashTable` method `get` .
* Recall that this method must skip over previously occupied cells when probing for a target item.
* This profiler should insert a set of data items into the table
* Remove a specified number of them
* Run `get` with the remaining items.

> Make sure to add the `__len__()`, `__str__()`, `getLoadFactor()`, `getHomeIndex()`, `getActualIndex()`, `getProbeCount()` and `get()` methods in the `HashTable` class of the *hashtable.py* file from exercise 3.

The programmer should be able to view results of the following:
1. Total numer of collisions.
2. Total number of probes.
3. Average number of probes per collision.


Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Table: [40, None, ..., ..., ..., ..., 30, 70]
Table: [True, None, ..., ..., ..., ..., 30, 70]
Load Factor  Item Accessed  Home Index  Actual Index   Probes
   0.500            10           2           2             0
   0.500            30           6           6             0
   .....            ..           .           .             .
   .....            ..           .           .             .
Total collisions: 2
Total probes: 2
Average probes per collision: 1.0
```
