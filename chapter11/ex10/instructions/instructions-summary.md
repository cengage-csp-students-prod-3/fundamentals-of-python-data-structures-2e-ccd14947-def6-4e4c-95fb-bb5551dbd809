The Python function `zip` is used to pack data into dictionary.
* `zip` expects a list of keys and a list of values as arguments and returns a new iterable zip object.
* Passing this object to the `dict` function builds and returns a dictionary with these data.
> Thus, this function behaves like the constructor `__init__` methods for the dictionaries discussed in this chapter.

A function `unzip` would be the inverse of `zip`.
* `unzip` expects a dictionary as an argument and returns a tuple, which contains a list of the dictionary’s keys and a list of their corresponding values. 

> Make sure to remove the methods `__len__()`, `__str__()` and `__add__()` from exercise 9 to the *treesorteddict.py* file.

In the *abstractdict.py* file complete the following:
1. Finish the `get` method in the `AbstractDict` class.
2. Add a method named `unzip` to the `AbstractDict` class that performs this operation for all dictionaries in the collections framework.

To test your program run the `main` method in the *testdict.py* file. 

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
The dictionary:  {1:Value1, 2:Value2, 3:Value3, 4:Value4, 5:Value5}

The keys: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The values: ['Value1', '......', '......', '......', 'Value5']

The items: ['1:Value1', '.........', '.........', '......... '5:Value5']

Unzip: ([1, ., ., ., 5], ['Value1', '......', '......', '......', 'Value5'])
```
