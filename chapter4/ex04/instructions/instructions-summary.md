The `insert()` and `pop()` methods should use the strategies discussed in this chapter, including adjusting the length of the array, if necessary.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 4.3* as your starter file for the *arrays.py* file.

In the `Array` class of the *arrays.py* file complete the following:
1. Define the `insert()` method:
	- The `insert()` method expects a position and an item as arguments and inserts the item at the given position.
	- If the position is greater than or equal to the array’s logical size, the method inserts the item after the last item currently available in the array.
2. Define the `pop()` method:
	- The `pop()` method expects a position as an argument and removes and returns the item at that position.
	- The `pop()` method’s precondition is `0 <= index < size()`.
	- The `pop()` method should also reset the vacated array cell to the fill value.
	
To test your program run the `main()` method below in the *arrays.py* file:
```
def main():
    """Test code for modified Array class."""
    a = Array(5)
    print ("Physical size:", len(a))
    print ("Logical size:", a.size())
    print ("Items:", a)
    for item in range(4):
        a.insert(0, item)
    print ("Items:", a)
    a.insert(1, 77)
    print ("Items:", a)
    a.insert(10, 10)
    print ("Items:", a)
    print(a.pop(3))
    print ("Items:", a)
    for count in range(5):
        print(a.pop(0), end = " ")
    print ()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Physical size: 5
Logical size: 0
Items: [None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [3, 2, 1, 0, None]
Items: [3, 77, 2, 1, 0]
Items: [3, 77, 2, 1, 0, 10, None, None, None, None]
1
Items: [3, 77, 2, 0, 10, None, None, None, None, None]
3 77 2 0 10
```
