This exercise asks you to define some functions for manipulating linked structures. You should use the `Node` and `TwoWayNode` classes, as defined in this chapter. 

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 4.8* as your starter file for the *testnode.py* file.

In the *testnode.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `insert` method that inserts an item into a singly linked structure at a given position.
	- The function expects three arguments:
		- item, `index`
		- position, `newItem`
		- linked structure, `head`
	- If the position is greater than or equal to the structure’s length, the function inserts the item at its end.
		- Searches for the node at position index -1 or the last position
		- Inserts new node after node at position index -1 or the last position
	- The function returns the modified linked structure.

An example call of the function, where `head` is a variable, is either an empty link or refers to the
first node of a structure, `head = insert(1, data, head)`.

To test your program run the `main()` method below in the *testnode.py* file.
```
def main():
    """Tests modifications."""
    head = None

    head = insert(0, "1", head)
    print("1:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    head = insert(1, "2", head)
    print("1 2:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    head = insert(0, "0", head)
    print("0 1 2:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    head = insert(3, "3", head)
    print("0 1 2 3:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    head = insert(1, "9", head)
    print("0 9 1 2 3:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```
Your program's output should look like the following:
```
1: 1 
1 2: 1 2 
0 1 2: 0 1 2 
0 1 2 3: 0 1 2 3 
0 9 1 2 3: 0 9 1 2 3 
```
