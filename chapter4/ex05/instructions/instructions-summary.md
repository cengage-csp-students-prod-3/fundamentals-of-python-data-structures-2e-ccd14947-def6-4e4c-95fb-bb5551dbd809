In the `Array` class of the *arrays.py* file complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 4.4* as your starter file for the *arrays.py* file.

1. Define the `__eq__` method.
	- Python runs this method when an `Array` object appears as the left operand of the `==` operator.
	- The method returns `True` if its argument is:
		- Also an `Array`, 
		- Has the same logical size as the left operand
		- The pair of items at each logical position in the two arrays are equal.
	- Otherwise, the method returns `False`.
	
To test your program run the `main()` method below in the *arrays.py* file:
```
def main():
    """Test code for modified Array class."""
    a = Array(5)
    for item in range(4):
        a.insert(0, item)
    b = a
    c = Array(5)
    for item in range(4):
        c.insert(0, item)
    print("True:", a == b)
    print("True:", a is b)
    print("True:", a == c)
    print("False:", a is c)
    c.insert(10, 10)
    print("False:", a == c)
    c.pop(c.size() - 1)
    c[2] = 6
    print("False:", a == c)
    d = []
    print("False:", a == d)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
True: True
True: True
True: True
False: False
False: False
False: False
False: False
```
