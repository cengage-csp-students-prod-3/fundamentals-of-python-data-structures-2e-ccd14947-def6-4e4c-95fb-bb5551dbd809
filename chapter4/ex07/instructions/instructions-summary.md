A `Matrix` class can be used to perform some of the operations found in linear algebra, such as matrix arithmetic.

Develop a `Matrix` class that uses the built-in operators for arithmetic.

In the *matrix.py* file, complete the following:
1. Define the `Matrix` class and extend the `Grid` class.
2. Complete the implementation of the following methods:
	- `__init__`
	- `__add__`, adds two matrices together.
		- Returns the sum of self and other.
	- `__sub__`, subtracts two matrices.
		- Returns the difference of self and other.
	- `__mul__`, multiplies two matrices together.
		- Returns the product of self and other.
		- If two matrices cannot be multiplied, raise an `Exception`.
		
To test your program run the `main()` method in the *matrix.py* file.
		
Your program's output should look like the following:
```
6 6 6 
6 6 6 
6 6 6 

2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 
2 2 2 2 

24 24 
24 24
```
