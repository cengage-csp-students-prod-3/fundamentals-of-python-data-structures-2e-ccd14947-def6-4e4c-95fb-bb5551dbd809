In the `Array` class of the *arrays.py* file complete the following:
1. Add preconditions to the methods ``` __getitem__ ``` and ``` __setitem__ ```.
	- The precondition of each method is ``` 0 <= index < size() ```.
	- Be sure to raise an `IndexError` exception if the precondition is not satisfied.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *arrays.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Physical size: 10
Logical size: 0
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
Traceback (most recent call last):

    print(a[0])

    raise IndexError("Array index out of bounds")
