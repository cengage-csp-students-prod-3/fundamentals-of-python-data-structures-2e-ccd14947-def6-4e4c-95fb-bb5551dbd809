The `grow()` and `shrink()` methods should use the strategies discussed in this chapter to increase or decrease the length of the list contained in the array.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 4.2* as your starter file for the *arrays.py* file.

In the `Array` class of the *arrays.py* file complete the following:
1. Define the `grow()` method.
	- Add the fillValue to the new cells in the underlying list
	- Each call to `grow()` should double the physical size.
	- Make sure that the array’s cells use the fillValue when the array’s size is increased.
2. Define the `shrink()` method.
	- Shrink the size by half but not below the default capacity
	- Remove those garbage cells from the underlying list
	- Make sure that the physical size of the array does not shrink below the user-specified capacity.

To test your program run the `main()` method below in the *arrays.py* file:
```
def main():
    """Test code for modified Array class."""
    a = Array(5)
    print("Physical size:", len(a))
    print("Logical size:", a.size())
    print("Items:", a)
    a.grow()
    print("Items:", a)
    a.grow()
    print("Items:", a)
    a.shrink()
    print("Items:", a)
    a.shrink()
    print("Items:", a)
    a.shrink()
    print("Items:", a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Physical size: 5
Logical size: 0
Items: [None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [None, None, None, None, None]
Items: [None, None, None, None, None]
```
