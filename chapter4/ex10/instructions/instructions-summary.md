This exercise asks you to define some functions for manipulating linked
structures. You should use the `Node` and `TwoWayNode` classes, as defined in this
chapter.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 4.9* as your starter file for the *testnode.py* file.

In the *testnode.py* file complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `pop()` method that removes the item at a given position from a singly linked structure.
	- This function expects a position as a first argument, with
	- Precondition: `0 <= index < length(head)` of structure
	- Raises: `IndexError` exception if this condition is not met.
	- It's second argument is the linked structure, which, of course, cannot be empty.
	- The function returns a `tuple` containing the modified linked structure and the item that was removed. An example call is `(head, item) = pop(1, head)`.

To test your program run the `main()` method below in the *testnode.py* file:
```
def main():
    """Tests modifications."""
    head = None

    head = insert(0, "1", head)
    print("1:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    (head, item) = pop(0, head)
    print("1:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    # Add five nodes to the beginning of the linked structure
    for count in range(1, 6):
        head = Node(count, head)
    
    (head, item) = pop(0, head)
    print("5 4 3 2 1:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)
    
    (head, item) = pop(length(head) - 1, head)
    print("1 4 3 2:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    (head, item) = pop(1, head)
    print("3 4 2:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    pop(4, head)
    
if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
1: 1 
1: 1 
5 4 3 2 1: 5 4 3 2 1 
1 4 3 2: 1 4 3 2 
3 4 2: 3 4 2
