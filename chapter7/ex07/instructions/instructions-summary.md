Modify the program of *Programming Exercise 7.6* so that it checks the __infix__ string for syntax errors
as it converts to __postfix__. The error-detection and recovery strategy should be similar to the one used in the case study.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 7.6* as your starter file for the *scanner.py*, *tokens.py* and *converter.py* files.

In the `IFToPFConverter` class of the *converter.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `__str__()` method.
	- Checks if the `expressionSoFar` is empty or not
		- Returns the portion of the expression processed or **none** if empty, before the exception was raised
	- Checks if the `operatorStack` is empty or not `operatorStack.isEmpty()`
		- Returns the operators on the stack or if empty print **The stack is empty**
2. Modify the `convert()` method to raise exceptions
	- If a token is unrecognized raise an AttributeError: **Unrecognized symbol**
	- If the `operatorStack` is empty raise an AttributeError: **Too few operators**
		- Raise this exception for every operator
3. Complete the implementation of the `conversionStatus` method that when the converter detects a syntax error, it should raise an exception.
	- The `main` function catches in a _try-except_ statement.
	- The `main` function can then call `conversionStatus` to obtain the information to print when an error occurs.
		- This information should include the portion of the expression scanned until the error is detected.
		- The error messages should also be as specific as possible.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *converter.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Enter an infix expression: 3 * 0
Postfix: 3 0 * 
Enter an infix expression: 3 4 2 5
Too few operators 
Portion of expression processed: 3 4 2 5 
The stack is empty
Enter an infix expression: 5 + 6 - 3 & 9
Unrecognized symbol 
Portion of expression processed: 5 + 6 - 3 & 
Operators on the stack          : [-]
Enter an infix expression: 2 $ 3
Unrecognized symbol 
Portion of expression processed: 2 $ 
The stack is empty
```
> The test above made sure postfix was working as expected and tested every exception.
