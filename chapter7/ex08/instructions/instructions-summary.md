Integrate the __infix__ to __postfix__ `converter` from *Exercise 7* into the expression `evaluator` of the case study. Thus, the input to the program is a purported
__infix__ expression, and its output is either its value or an error message. The program’s main components are the `converter` and the `evaluator`.

If the `converter` detects a syntax error, the `evaluator` is not to run. Thus, the `evaluator` can assume
that its input is a syntactically correct __postfix__ expression (which may still contain semantic errors, such as the attempt to divide by 0).

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 7.7* as your starter file for the *scanner.py*, *tokens.py* and *converter.py* files and your solution from *Programming Exercise 7.4* as your starter file for the *model.py* file.

In the `PFEvaluatorModel` class of the *model.py* file, complete the following:
1. Import the `IFToPFConverter` class from the *converter.py* file.
2. Modify the `evaluate()` method.
	- The `evaluator` will no longer be the scanner, set to **None**
	- The `converter` will now scan the `sourceStr` and creates a scanner with it.
	- The scanner is then passed as an argument to the constructor of the converter object and set as `postfix`
	- The `evaluator` then creates an object of `postfix`
	- The `postfix` expression is then evaluated
		- Return the value of the evaluation
3. Modify the `evaluationStatus` method.
	- Check to see if an evaluation has been done first.

To test your program run the `run()` method in the *evaluatorapp.py* file.

> Tests will be run against both *converter.py* and *evaluatorapp.py*.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Enter an infix expression: 10 + 10
10 + 10 
20
Enter an infix expression: 11
11 
Too few operators 
Portion of expression processed: 11 
The stack is empty

Enter an infix expression: 2 $ 3
2 $ 3 
Unrecognized symbol 
Portion of expression processed: 2 $ 
The stack is empty
```
