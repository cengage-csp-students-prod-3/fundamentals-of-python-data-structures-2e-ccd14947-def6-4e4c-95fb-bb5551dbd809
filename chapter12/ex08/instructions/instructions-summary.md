In the `LinkedDirectedGraph` class of the *graph.py* file complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 12.7* as your starter file for the *graph.py* file.

1. Add the method `makeDistanceMatrix()` to the `LinkedDirectedGraph` class.
	- This method calls the `makeLabelTable()` method (see *Exercise 7*) to build a table and then uses the table to build and return a distance matrix.
	- You should define `INFINITY` as a class variable with the value **"-"**.

To test your program run the methods in the *testdirected.py* file.

> The tester program builds and views a matrix which includes a function that prints a distance matrix with the rows and columns labeled as in *Figure 12-20*.

![Figure shows a directed graph and its adjacency matrix. The directed graph has the vertex B labeled 1 with an edge pointing to the vertex A that is labeled 0. The vertex B has an edge pointing to the vertex C which is labeled 2. The vertex B also has an edge pointing to the vertex D which is labeled 3. The vertex D has an edge that points to the vertex C. A matrix is shown nearby. The rows are labeled A, B, C, D and also with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. The columns are also labeled similarly. The row entries for A are 0, 0, 0, 0. The row entries of B are 1, 0, 1, 1. The row entries for C are 0, 0, 0, 0. The row entries for D are 0, 0, 1, 0.](../assets/UijagsMsTZehfekpBtlQ.png)

![Figure shows the initial distance matrix for the graph in figure 12-19. The matrix has rows and columns from A to G labeled with numbers from 0 to 6. The row entries are as follows. Row A: 0, 80, infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity. Row B: 80, 0, 79, infinity, 153, infinity, infinity. Row C: infinity, 79, 0, 78, infinity, 74, infinity. Row D: infinity, infinity, 78, 0, 98, 89, infinity. Row E: infinity, 153, infinity, 98, 0, infinity, infinity. Row F: infinity, infinity, 74, 89, infinity, 0, 67. Row G: infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity, 67, 0.](../assets/oUx16D1XQWSxWnJKwklQ.png)
