In the *algorithms.py* file, complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 12.2* as your starter file for the *graph.py* file.

1. Complete the implementation of the `spanTree()` method.

To test your program run the `run()` method in the `GraphDemoView` class of the *view.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-7]: 2
Enter the file name: topo.txt
Graph created successfully
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-7]: 5
Tree: >s:0 >q:0 >t:0 >r:0
