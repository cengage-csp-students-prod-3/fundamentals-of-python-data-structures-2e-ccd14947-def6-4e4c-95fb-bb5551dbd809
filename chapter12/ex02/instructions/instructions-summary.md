Complete the classes in the case study and test the operations to input a graph and display it.

In the `LinkedDirectedGraph` class of the *graph.py* file, complete the following:
1. Add all the methods from your solution of *Programming Exercise 12.1* to the *graph.py* file:
	- `addVertex()`
	- `getVertex()`
	- `addEdge()`
	- `getEdge()`

In the *view.py* file, complete the following:
1. Test the operations from an inputted graph by executing the `run()` method
	- In the terminal, select option 1 and **input a graph from the keyboard**.
		- Enter atleast one edge to the inputted graph

> You must execute the program and complete the steps above, to check that you have *Successfully added a graph through input from the keyboard*

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-7]: 1
Enter an edge or return to quit: >s:0
Enter an edge or return to quit: >q:0
Enter an edge or return to quit: >t:0
Enter an edge or return to quit: 
Enter the start label: p
