In the *algorithms.py* file, complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 12.3* as your starter file for the *graph.py* and *algorithms.py* files.

1. Complete the implementation of the `shortestPaths` method.

To test your program run the `run()` method in the `GraphDemoView` class of the *view.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-7]: 2
Enter the file name: topo.txt
Graph created successfully
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-7]: 4
Paths:
 p 0 None 
s 0 p 
q 0 p 
t 0 s 
r 0 q
