Complete the adjacency list implementation of the directed graph collection, including the specification and enforcement of preconditions on any methods that should have them.

In the `LinkedDirectedGraph` class of the *graph.py* file complete the following:
1. Complete the `addVertex()` method
	- Precondition: a vertex with label must not already be in the graph.
	- Raises: AttibuteError if a vertex with label is already in the graph.

2. Complete the `getVertex()` method
	- Precondition: a vertex with label must already be in the graph.
	- Raises: AttibuteError if a vertex with label is not already in the graph.

3. Complete the `addEdge()` method
	- Connects the vertices with an edge with the given weight.
	- Preconditions: vertices with fromLabel and toLabel must already be in the graph. The vertices must not already be connected by an edge.
	- Raises: AttibuteError if the vertices are not already in the graph or they are already connected.

4. Complete the `getEdge()` method
	- Returns the edge connecting the two vertices, or None if no edge exists.
	- Precondition: vertices with fromLabel and toLabel must already be in the graph.
	- Raises: AttibuteError if the vertices are not already in the graph.

To test your program run the above methods in the *testdirected.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Expect vertices ABC and no edges: 
3 Vertices:  A B C
0 Edges: 
Expect same vertices and edges AB BC CB all with weight 2.5: 
3 Vertices:  A B C
3 Edges:  >B:2.5 >C:2.5 >B:2.5
Expect A:  A
Edge from A to B: >B:2.5
Edge from B to A: None
Incident edges of A: ['A>B:2.5']
```
