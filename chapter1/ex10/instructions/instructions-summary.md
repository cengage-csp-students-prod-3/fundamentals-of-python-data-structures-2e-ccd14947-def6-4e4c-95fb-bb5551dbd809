A simple course management system models a student’s information with a name and a set of test scores. 
This system should be able to create a student object with a given name and a number of scores, all of which will be 0 at startup. 

The system should be able to access or replace a score at the given position (counting from 0):
1. obtain the number of scores - `getNumberOfScores()`
2. obtain the highest score - `getHighScore()`
3. obtain the average score - `getAverage()`
4. obtain the student’s name - `getName()`

In addition, the `student` object when printed should show the student’s name and scores as in the following example: 
```
Name: Ken Lambert 
Score 1: 88 
Score 2: 77 
Score 3: 100 
High score: 100
Average: 88.333
```
Define a `Student` class that supports these features and  behavior.
A `main()` has been provided for you in order to test the implementation of your `Student` class.
