Complete and test the circular array implementation of the queue collection discussed in this chapter.

In the *arrayqueue.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `clear()` method
	- Makes self become empty.
2. Complete the implementation of the `add()` method
	- Inserts item at rear of the queue.
3. Complete the implementation of the `pop()` method
	- Removes and returns the item at the front of the queue.
	- Raise KeyError if queue is empty

>Verify that exceptions are raised when preconditions are violated and that the implementation adds or removes storage as needed.

In the *linkedqueue.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the `clear()` method
	- Makes self become empty.

To test your program run the `test` method in the *testqueue.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Length: 0
Empty: True
Add 1-10
Peeking: 1
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length: 10
Empty: False
Items in clone (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length of clone after clear: 0
Pop 3 items: 1 2 3 
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding 11 and 12:
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Popping items (front to rear): 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 
Length: 0
Empty: True
Create with 11 items:
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Popping two items:  1 2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding five items: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
