When you send a file to be printed on a shared printer, it is put onto a print queue with other jobs. Anytime before your job prints, you can access the queue to remove it. Thus, some queues support a `remove` operation.

The `remove()` method should expect an item as an argument. It should remove the given item in the queue or raise an exception if the item is not found.

In the *arrayqueue.py* file, complete the following:
1. Define the `remove()` method to the `ArrayQueue` class implementation.

In the *linkedqueue.py* file, complete the following:
1. Define the `remove()` method to the `LinkedQueue` class implementation.

To test your program run the `test()` method in the *testqueue.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Length: 0
Empty: True
Add 1-10
Peeking: 1
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length: 10
Empty: False
Items in clone (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length of clone after clear: 0
Pop 3 items: 1 2 3 
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding 11 and 12:
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Popping items (front to rear): 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 
Length: 0
Empty: True
Create with 11 items:
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Popping two items:  1 2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding five items: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Removing 6: [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
> The example above is testing the `ArrayQueue` class. Be sure to also test the `LinkedQueue` class.
