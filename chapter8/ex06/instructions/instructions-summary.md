Modify the simulation of _Exercise 5_ so that it takes account of both factors:

1. The length of a line of customers waiting to check out.
2. The physical proximity of a cashier.

You should assume that a customer initially arrives at the checkout line of a random cashier and then chooses a cashier who is no more than two lines away from this spot. This simulation should have at least four cashiers.

In the `MarketModel` class of the _marketmodel.py_ file, complete the following:

1. Return the cashier for the next customer, based on the shortest line of customers no more than two lines away.
   - Pick a random index and create a sublist of the allowable cashiers
   - Search the short list for the cashier with the shortest line

To test your program run the `main()` method in the _marketapp.py_ file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

```
Welcome to the Market Simulator!

Enter the total running time: 30
Enter the average processing time per customer: 3
Enter the probability of a new arrival: 1
Enter the number of cashiers: 4
