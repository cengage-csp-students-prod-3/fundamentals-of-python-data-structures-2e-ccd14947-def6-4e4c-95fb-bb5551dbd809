A `sorted bag` behaves just like a regular `bag` but allows the user to visit its items
in ascending order with the `for` loop. Therefore, the items added to this type of `bag` 
must have a natural ordering and recognize the comparison operators. Some
examples of such items are strings and integers.

Complete the implementation of the array-based sorted bag defined in a new class named `ArraySortedBag` that supports the capability, like
the `ArrayBag` class, but its `in` operation can now run in logarithmic time. To accomplish this the `ArraySortedBag` class must place new items into its array in a sorted order.

> A version of the `ArrayBag` class has been copied into the file *arraysortedbag.py* as an optional starting point. 

In the *arraysortedbag.py* file, complete the following in the `ArraySortedBag` class:
1. Modify the `add()` method to insert new items in their proper places.
	- If the array is empty or the item is last item then add the item
	- If the array is not empty or the item is not the last item:
		- Check if first item is greater or equal to the new item
		- Open a hole for new the item
		- Insert the item and update the size
2. Finish the implementation of the new defined `__contains__` method to implement the new, more efficient search that works as the `in` operator.
	- Returns True if the item is in self, or False otherwise.
3. Change all references to `ArrayBag` to be `ArraySortedBag`. 

To test your program run the `test` method in the *testbag.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Testing <class 'arraysortedbag.ArraySortedBag'>
The list of items added is: [1, 8, 9, 4, 7, 5, 10, 6, 3, 2]
Expect the bag's string, in ascending order: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Add 5 more items to test increasing the array size:
Expect the bag's string: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
```
