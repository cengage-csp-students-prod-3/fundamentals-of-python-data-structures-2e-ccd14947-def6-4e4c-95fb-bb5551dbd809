The `remove()` method resizes the array when necessary by removing an item from the array if it exist

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 5.3* as your starter file for the *arraybag.py* file.

In the *arraybag.py* file define the `remove()` method in the `ArrayBag` class by completing the following:
1. Check the precondition and raise a KeyError if necessary
	- Precondition: item is in self.
	- Raises: KeyError if item in not in self.
	- Postcondition: item is removed from self.
2. Search for the index of the target item
3. Shift items to the left of target up by one position
4. Decrement logical size
5. Check array memory here and decrease it if necessary

To test your program run the `testResize()` method in the *testbag.py* file.

Added 100 items, length of bag = 100
Expect 160 as length of array = 160

Removed 76 items, expect 24 as length of bag: 24
Expect 80 as length of array = 80
Removed remaining items, length of bag = 0
Expect 10 as length of array = 10
