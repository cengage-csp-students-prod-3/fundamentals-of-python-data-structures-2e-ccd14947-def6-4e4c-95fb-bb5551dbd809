Python’s `for` loop allows the programmer to add or remove items in the collection
over which the loop is iterating. Some designers worry that changing
the structure of a collection during iteration might cause program crashes. The
remedy is to make the `for` loop _read-only_, by disallowing mutations to the collection
during iteration. You can detect such mutations by keeping a count of
them and determining if this count goes up at any point within the collection’s
`__iter__` method. When this happens, you can raise an exception to prevent the
computation from going forward. 

In the *arraybag.py* file complete the following in the `ArrayBag` class:
1. In the `__init__` method, include a new instance variable named `modCount`, which is set to __0__.
2. In the `__iter__` method include a temporary variable named `modCount`, which is set initially to the value of the instance variable `self.modCount`.
	- Immediately after an item is yielded within the `__iter__` method, you raise an exception if the values of the two mod counts are not equal. 
3. In the mutator method `clear()` set `modCount` to __0__
4. In the mutator methods `add()` and `remove()` increment the `modCount` variable.

	
To test your implementation of `ArrayBag` run the `test` method in the *testbag.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Testing <class 'arraybag.ArrayBag'>
The list of items added is: [9, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 1, 5, 10, 6]
Expect the bag's string, in ascending order: {9, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 1, 5, 10, 6}
Add 5 more items to test increasing the array size:
Expect the bag's string: {9, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 1, 5, 10, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
