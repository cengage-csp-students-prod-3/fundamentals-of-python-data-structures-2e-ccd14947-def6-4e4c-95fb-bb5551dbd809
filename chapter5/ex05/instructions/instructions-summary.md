The `clone()` method expects no arguments when called, and returns an exact copy of the type of bag on which it is called.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 5.4* as your starter file for the *arraybag.py* file.

In the *arraybag.py* file complete the following:
1. Define the `clone()` method to the `ArrayBag` class.
	- Returns a copy of self.

In the *linkedbag.py* file complete the following:
1. Define the `clone()` method to the `LinkedBag` class.
	- Returns a copy of self.

For example, the variable __bag2__ would contain the numbers
**2**, **3** and **4** at the end of the following code segment:

```Python
bag1 = ArrayBag([2,3,4])
bag2 = bag1.clone()
bag1 == bag2 # Returns True
bag1 is bag2 # Returns False
```
