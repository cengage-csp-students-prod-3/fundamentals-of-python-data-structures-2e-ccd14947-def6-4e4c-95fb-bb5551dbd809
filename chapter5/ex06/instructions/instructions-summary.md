A `set` is an unordered collection with the same interface as a `bag`. However, the
items in a `set` are unique, whereas a `bag` can contain duplicate items.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 5.5* as your starter file for the *arraybag.py* and *linkedbag.py* files.

Complete the implementation of the array-based set defined in the new class named `ArraySet` that implements an array-based `set` type.

>Hint: Much of the code in the `ArrayBag` class from the *arraybag.py* file can be reused.

In the *arrayset.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the accessor methods:
	- `isEmpty()`, returns true if len(self) == 0, or false otherwise.
	- `__len__`, returns the number of items in self.
	- `__str__`, returns the string representation of self.
	- `__iter__`, supports iteration over a view of self.
	- `__add__`, returns anew set containing the contents of self and other
	- `clone`, return a copy of self.
	- `__eq__`, returns true if self equals other, or false otherwise
	- `count`, return the numer of instance of item in self.
2. Complete the mutator methods:
	- `clear`, makes self become empty.
	- `add`, adds item to self and ignores the item if it’s already in the set.
		- Check array memory and increase it if necessary
	- `remove`, removes item from self if it's in self.
		- Check precondition and raise KeyError if necessary
		- Search for the index of the target item
		- Shift items to the left of target up by one position
		- Decrement logical size
		- Check array memory here and decrease it if necessary
	
To test your program run the `test` method in the *testset.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Testing <class 'arrayset.ArraySet'>
The list of items added is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Expect the set's string: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Add same items to test for uniqueness:
Expect the set's string: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```
