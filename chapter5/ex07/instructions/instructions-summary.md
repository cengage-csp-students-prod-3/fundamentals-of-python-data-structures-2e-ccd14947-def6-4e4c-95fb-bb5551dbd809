Complete the implementation of the link-based set defined in the new class named `LinkedSet` that implements a `set` type using linked nodes. 

>Hint: Much of the code in the `LinkedBag` class from your solution of the *linkedbag.py* file in *Programming Exercise 5.5* can be reused.

In the *linkedset.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the accessor methods:
	- `isEmpty()`, returns true if len(self) == 0, or false otherwise.
	- `__len__`, returns the number of items in self.
	- `__str__`, returns the string representation of self.
	- `__iter__`, supports iteration over a view of self.
	- `__add__`, returns anew set containing the contents of self and other
	- `clone`, return a copy of self.
	- `__eq__`, returns true if self equals other, or false otherwise
	- `count`, return the numer of instance of item in self.
2. Complete the mutator methods:
	- `clear`, makes self become empty.
	- `add`, adds item to self and ignores the item if it’s already in the set.
		- Check array memory and increase it if necessary
	- `remove`, removes item from self if it's in self.
		- Check precondition and raise KeyError if necessary
		- Search for the node containing the target item, probe will point to the target node, and trailer will point to the one before it, if it exists.
		- Unhook the node to be deleted, either the first one or one thereafter.
		- Decrement logical size
	
To test your program run the `test` method in the *testset.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Testing <class 'linkedset.LinkedSet'>
The list of items added is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Expect the set's string: {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
Add same items to test for uniqueness:
Expect the set's string: {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```
