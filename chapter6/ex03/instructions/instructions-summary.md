Modify the `AbstractBag` class so that it behaves as a subclass of `AbstractCollection` provided in the file *abstractcollection.py*.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 6.2* as your starter file for the *arraysortedbag.py* and *linkedbag.py* files.

In the `AbstractBag` class of the *abstractbag.py* file, complete the following:
1. Import the `AbstractCollection` class from the *abstractcollection.py* file
2. Modify the `__init__` so that it contains the contents of sourceCollection from the `AbstractCollection` class, if it's present. 
3. Remove any methods that are redundant from the `AbstractBag` class.

> Be sure to retain in the `AbstractBag` class only those methods that cannot
be moved to `AbstractCollection`.

To test your program run the `test()` method in the *testbag.py* file.
