Modify the `LinkedBag` class discussed in *Chapter 5, Exercise 7* (provided in *linkedbag.py*), so that it becomes a subclass
of `AbstractBag`.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 6.1* as your starter file for the *arraysortedbag.py* file.

In the `LinkedBag` class of the *linkedbag.py* file, complete the following:
1. Import the `AbstractBag` class from the *abstractbag.py* file
2. Modify the `__init__` so that it contains the contents of sourceCollection from the `AbstractBag` class, if it's present. 
3. Remove any methods that are redundant from the `LinkedBag` class.

> Be sure to retain in the `LinkedBag` class only those methods that cannot
be moved to `AbstractBag`.

To test your program run the `test()` method in the *testbag.py* file.
