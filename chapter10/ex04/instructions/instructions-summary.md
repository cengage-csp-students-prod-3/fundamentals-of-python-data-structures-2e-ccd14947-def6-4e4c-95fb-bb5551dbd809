A successor is the smallest item in the tree that is greater than the given item.
A predecessor is the largest item in the tree that is less than the given item.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 10.3* as your starter file for the *linkedbst.py* file.

In the `LinkedBST` class of the *linkedbst.py* file, complete the following:
1. Define the `successor()` method.
	- Returns the smallest item that is larger than item, or None if there is no such item.
	- Expects an item as an argument and returns an item or `None`.
2. Define the `predecessor()` method
	- Returns the largest item that is smaller than item, or None if there is no such item.
	- Expects an item as an argument and returns an item or `None`.
	
>Note: The successor may exist even if the given item is not present in the tree.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *testbst.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Adding D B A C F E G

String:
| | G
| F
| | E
D
| | C
| B
| | A

Predecessor of D:  C
Successor of D:  E
Predecessor of B:  A
Successor of B:  C
Predecessor of A:  None
Successor of A:  B
Predecessor of C:  B
Successor of C:  D
Predecessor of F:  E
Successor of F:  G
Predecessor of E:  D
Successor of E:  F
Predecessor of G:  F
Successor of G:  None
Predecessor of Q:  G
Successor of Q:  None
```
