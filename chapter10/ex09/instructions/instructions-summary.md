Complete the parser developed in the starter files of this chapter.

The parser should also handle the exponentiation operator `^`. Recall that this operator has a higher precedence than `*` and `/` and is right associative. This means that the expression `2 ^ 3 ^ 4` is equivalent to `2 ^ (3 ^ 4)`, not `(2 ^ 3) ^ 4`.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 10.8* as your starter file for the *expressiontree.py* and *tokens.py* files.

In the `Parser` class of the *parsers.py* file, complete the following:
1. To handle the syntax and semantics of exponent, rename the rule (and method in the parser) from `factor` to `primary`.
2. Add a new rule named `factor` to the grammar, and a corresponding method to the parser.
	- A `factor` now is a `primary`, followed by an optional `^` operator and another `factor`.

To test your program run the `run()` method in the *parserapp.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Enter an infix expression: 2 ^ (3 ^ 4)       
Prefix: ^ 2 ^ 3 4
Infix: (2 ^ (3 ^ 4))
Postfix: 2 3 4 ^ ^
Value: 2417851639229258349412352
```
