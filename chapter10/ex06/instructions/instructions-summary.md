The `ArraySortedSet` class discussed in *Chapter 6, Exercise 7* is an array-based implementation of a sorted set collection. A linked implementation, named `TreeSortedSet`,
uses a binary search tree. Complete and test this new implementation of a sorted set collection.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 10.5* as your starter file for the *linkedbst.py* file.

In the `TreeSortedSet` class of the *treesortedset.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the following methods:
	- `__init__`
	- `__iter__`
	- `__eq__`
	- `clear()`
	- `add()`
	- `remove()`

Compare the run-time performance of the `add`, `remove`, and `clear` operations of the two implementations of sorted sets.

To test your program run the `test()` method in the *testset.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
The list of items added is: [2013, 61, 1973]
Expect 3: 3
Expect the set's string: {61, 1973, 2013}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
Expect the items on separate lines:
61
1973
2013
Expect {}: {}
Expect {}: {}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
Expect one of each item: {61, 1973, 2013}
Expect {}: {}
```
