In the `LinkedBST` class of the *linkedbst.py* file, complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 10.1* as your starter file for the *linkedbst.py* file.

1. Define the `height()` method.
	- The `height()` method returns the height of the tree, as defined in this chapter.
2. Define the `isBalanced()` method.
	- The `isBalanced()` method returns `True` if the height of the tree is less than twice the log<sub>2</sub> of its number of nodes, or `False` otherwise.
	
To test your program run the `main()` method in the *testbst.py* file.
	
Your program's output should look like the following:
