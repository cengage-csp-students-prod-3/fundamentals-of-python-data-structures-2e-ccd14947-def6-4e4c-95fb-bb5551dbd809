Complete the implementation of the `LinkedBST` class, in the *linkedbst.py* file, discussed in this chapter.

In the `LinkedBST` class of the *linkedbst.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `preorder()` method.
	- Supports a preorder traversal on a view of self.
2. Complete the implementation of the `inorder()` method.
	- Supports an inorder traversal on a view of self.
3. Complete the implementation of the `postorder()` method.
	- Supports a postorder traversal on a view of self.
4. Complete the implementation of the `levelorder()` method.
	- Supports a levelorder traversal on a view of self.
	
To test your program run the `main()` method in the *testbst.py* file.
You can reference this file to verify the requirements of the `LinkedBST` class.
	
Your program's output should look like the following:

>Output may vary because the last list is generated randomly

Expect True for tree == clone:  True

For loop: D B A C F E G 

inorder traversal: A B C D E F G 

preorder traversal: D B A C F E G 

postorder traversal: A C B E G F D 

levelorder traversal: D B F A C E G 

Removing all items: A B C D E F G
