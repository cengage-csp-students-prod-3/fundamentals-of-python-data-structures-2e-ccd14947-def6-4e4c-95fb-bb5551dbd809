In the `LinkedBST` class of the *linkedbst.py* file, complete the following:

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 10.2* as your starter file for the *linkedbst.py* file.

1. Add and define the `rebalance()` method.
	- The method copies the tree’s items to a list during an inorder traversal and then clears the tree.
	- The method then copies the items from the list back to the tree in such a manner that the shape of the tree is balanced. 

> Hint: Use a recursive helper function that repeatedly visits the items at the midpoints of portions of the list.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *testbst.py* file.
