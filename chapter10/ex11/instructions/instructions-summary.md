Modify the emergency room scheduler case study program from *Chapter 8, Exercise 8*, so that it uses a heap-based priority queue called `HeapPriorityQueue` located in the *heappriorityqueue.py* file. The `isEmpty()`method resides in the `AbstractionCollection` class. 

In the `HeapPriorityQueue` class of the *heappriorityqueue.py* file complete the following:
1. Complete the heap-based priority queue implementation.
	1. Define the constructor method:
		- Add the `__init__` method:
			- Sets the initial state of self, which includes the contents of sourceCollection, if it's present.
	2. Define the accessor methods:
		- Add the `__iter__` method:
			- Supports iteration over a view of self
		- Add the `peek()` method:
			- Returns the item at the front of the queue.
			- Precondition: the queue is not empty.
			- Raises: KeyError if the stack is empty.
	3. Define the mutator methods:
		- Add the `clear()` method:
			- Makes self become empty.
		- Add the `add()` method:
			- Adds item to the rear of the queue.
		- Add the `pop()` method:
			- Removes and returns the item at the front of the queue.
			- Precondition: the queue is not empty.
			- Raises: KeyError if the queue is empty.
			- Postcondition: the front item is removed from the queue.

In the `AbstractionCollection`class of the *abstractcollection.py* file complete the following:
1. Modify the `isEmpty()` method:
	- Returns True if len(self) == 0, or False otherwise.

>It is important that patients are treated in the following order: critical, serious, fair. 

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *erapp.py* file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
Main menu
  1  Schedule a patient
  2  Treat the next patient
  3  Treat all patients
  4  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-4]: 1

Enter the patient's name: Ken
Patient's condition:
  1  Critical
  2  Serious
  3  Fair

Enter a number [1-3]: 1
Ken is added to the critical list

Main menu
  1  Schedule a patient
  2  Treat the next patient
  3  Treat all patients
  4  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-4]: 1

Enter the patient's name: Lambert
Patient's condition:
  1  Critical
  2  Serious
  3  Fair

Enter a number [1-3]: 1
Lambert is added to the critical list

Main menu
  1  Schedule a patient
  2  Treat the next patient
  3  Treat all patients
  4  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-4]: 2
Ken / critical is being treated.
Main menu
  1  Schedule a patient
  2  Treat the next patient
  3  Treat all patients
  4  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-4]: 3
Lambert / critical is being treated.
Main menu
  1  Schedule a patient
  2  Treat the next patient
  3  Treat all patients
  4  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-4]: 4
```
