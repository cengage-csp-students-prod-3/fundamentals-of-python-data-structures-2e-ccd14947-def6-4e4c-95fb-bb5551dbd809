Complete the list iterator for the `LinkedList` `class` in the _linkedlist.py_ file implementation that was discussed in this chapter.

Complete the following methods in the *linkedlist.py* file:
1. `hasNext()` returns True if the iterator has a next item or False otherwise.
2. `next()` returns the current item and advances the cursor to the next item.
3. `hasPrevious()` returns True if the iterator has a previous item or False otherwise.
4. `previous()` returns the current item and moves the cursor to the previous item.
5. `replace()` replaces the items at the current position with item.
6. `insert()` adds item to the end if the current position is undefined, or inserts it at that position.
7. `remove()` removes the item at the current position.

>Verify that exceptions are raised when preconditions are violated.

To test your program run the `testListIterator` method in the *testlistiterator.py* file.


Your program's output should look like the following:
```
TESTING A LIST ITERATOR FOR THE TYPE <class 'arraylist.ArrayList'>
Create a list with 1-9
Length: 9
Items in list (first to last): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Forward traversal with list iterator: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Backward traversal: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Inserting 10 before 3: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Removing 2: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Replace all items with 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Removing all items: Expect []: []
Length: 0
```
