Define the recursive functions `lispMap()` and `lispFilter()` for LISP constructed lists. Their behavior is similar to that of the Python functions `map()` and `filter()`, but the LISP functions return a list of the results.

>Be sure to reuse your solution from *Programming Exercise 9.9* as your starter file for the *lisplist.py* file.

In the `Node` class of the *lisplist.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the implementation of the `listMap()` function.
	- Returns the results of applying function to each item in lyst.
2. Complete the implementation of the `lispFilter()` function.
	- Returns the items that pass the Boolean test.

To test your program run the `main()` method in the *lisplist.py* file.	
	
Here is a sample interaction with this program:
```
>>> lyst = buildRange(1, 4)
>>> lyst
(1 2 3 4)
>>> lispMap(lambda x: x ** 2, lyst)
(1 4 9 16)
>>> lispFilter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lyst)
(2 4)
>>> lispFilter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0,
 lispMap(lambda x: x ** 2, lyst))
(4 16)
```
