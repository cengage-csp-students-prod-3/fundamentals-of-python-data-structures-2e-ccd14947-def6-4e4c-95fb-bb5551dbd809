Complete the array sorted list implementation in the *arraysortedlist.py* file that was discussed in this chapter.

In the `ArraySortedList` class of the *arraysortedlist.py* file, complete the following:
1. Complete the `add()` method, adds item to self.
	- Empty or last item, place at the end
	- Search for first item >= new item
	- Open a hole for new item
	- Insert item and update size
2. Complete the `index()` method.
	- Precondition: item is in the list
    - Returns the position of item
    - Raises: ValueError if the item is not in the list
3. Complete the `contains()` method.
	- Returns `True` if item is in the list, or `False` otherwise

You may defer the completion of the list iterator for sorted lists until the next project.

Your program's output should look like the following:
```
The list of items added is: [2013, 61, 1973]
Expect 3: 3
Expect the list's string: [61, 1973, 2013]
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
Expect the items on separate lines:
61
1973
2013
Expect []: []
Expect []: []
Expect True: ....
Expect False: ....
Expect two of each item: [61, .., ...., ...., ...., 2013]
Expect []: []
Expect crash with ValueError:
...
...
...
...
ValueError: 99 not in list.
```
